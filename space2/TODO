Clean out old clock stuff if new clock is working

Whatca want?
- fiddle around
- combat
- for next playsession (what exactly?) -- fly through ring, new systems, dark god interception -- only combat would be needed, but will not repeat that

Fiddle
- center (0,0) => Sun
- format info text on view
- flip-and-burn time command
- craft in list: speed, acc, course, tti

Course 1.0
- Try alternative course calculations
- Set course display text (i.e., course * or course * rel ... or course (0,0))
- On update time: update position in BurnSequence
- handle sx <= 0

big_bang defaults (time, heroes, space bodies, view params) should not be in universe

Tech dept
- animation should probably be paused when clock is not running ?
===================================================================================
multiple systems / travel through gate
Point of interest
hide/show object & list/unlist object
view <spaceobject> command => open image file
interception course: craft/weapons towards (moving) targets, max_g
Intercept cancelled if object suddenly is out of reach.
try to intercept slower speed
spaceobject view order
when moving objects, move them in the right order, so that orbiting works (dual stars orbits a fixed point, not eachother)
- planets first, then satellites, then satellites-satellistes (if any), then crafts on a course
lock everything on command, lock everything on update ???
verify: what are keys and visuals: keys are 1-2 characters, visuals are single char (first char of key), which is first two char of name
command identification of targets are the first letters of the name (ignore caps) until unambigious -- otherwise error
torps are 00, 01, ..., 09, 10, 11, 12, 13. Last digit is the visual char
missiles are named after their target(s), e.g., 00a, 00b, 00c -- missiles are removed when their target disappears
you can remove multiple missile by "00*". In general, the remove command takes multiple arguments (rm is also remove)
lay out torpedoes and send them off later, torps & missiles can also be sent after other targets (and possibly not detonate)
--------------------------------------
dont enhance belt (hacked for now). What is the logic here?
Ilus system
use # or . for ring zone ... how to handle 1377 gates ... when do not draw them all, just representatives
cmd full_stop: an object to a full stop (vel=0, acc=0, course cancelled)
cmd Reset ID: reread from file
disable superuser commands when in user mode
slow zone
max speed
output back to client
combat stuff made easy
flag: save world on exit (or error), save frequence
flag: restore world from newest file on startup

listen for event on resize window? and update view
"run" and "tick" should accept other than "seconds" as argument
