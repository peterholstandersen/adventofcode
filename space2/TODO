# usage, help <cmd>

Server will do show. Clients will fire commands.

when moving objects, move them in the right order, so that orbiting works (dual stars orbits a fixed point, not eachother)
- planets first, then satellites, then satellites-satellistes (if any), then crafts on a course

store "course" as INTERCEPT, ORBIT, TARGET(?) ... try to intercept slower speed

ansi stuff
what are keys and visuals: keys are 1-2 characters, visuals are single char (first char of key), which is first two char of name

torps are 00, 01, ..., 09, 10, 11, 12, 13. Last digit is the visual char
missiles are named after their target(s), e.g., 00a, 00b, 00c -- missiles are removed when their target disappears
you can remove multiple missile by "00*". In general, the remove command takes multiple arguments (rm is also remove)
lay out torpedoes and send them off later, torps & missiles can also be sent after other targets (and possibly not detonate)

astroid belt / saturn rings / objects with bulk / objects with texture (Jupitor)
Diffuse objects like the belts or Saturn's rings may return random to create a pattern.

use # or . for ring zone ... how to handle 1377 gates ... when do not draw them all, just representatives

Intercept course not cancelled if object suddenly is out of reach.
cmd full_stop: an object to a full stop (vel=0, acc=0, course cancelled)
cmd Reset ID: reread from file

disable superuser commands when in user mode

slow zone
max speed

output back to client

combat stuff made easy

how are courses implemented (and how shall they be used)
- interception course: craft/weapons towards (moving) targets, max_g

flag: save world on exit (or error), save frequence
flag: restore world from newest file on startup

code to read/write distances/time/acceleration

world
- tick
- start/stop

SpaceObject:

flip-and-burn towards target (moving or stationary)
